# Guess_The_Number
This is my first project (?) as a new guy in Python learning.
So Main is the chinese version and English_version is the english version.
The user can choose the range of number, and answer will be auto-generated. When the user made the wrong guess, the program will indicate if the answer is smaller or grater.
when the guess is correct, the user can choose if play again
The main problem is that there is too many loops, and i dont know how to reduce one.




新人勿喷
目前正在学python，因为是高中生所以学的比较慢。
玩家可以选择数字的范围，自动生成答案后，如果猜错了，会指出答案是更大还是更小。猜对后可以选择再来一局。
